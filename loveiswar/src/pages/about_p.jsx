        <strong>Love is War</strong> is a <strong>clothing brand from Chennai, India</strong>, redefining what it means to wear your values. We’re not just about fashion — we’re about <strong>making statements</strong>. Born from the streets, our pieces reflect <strong>actual street wear</strong>: raw, unapologetic, lasting.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        We don’t do fancy. We do real. Whether it's an oversized tee or a bold graphic drop, every piece is built to endure, just like the people who wear them. <strong>Love is War</strong> is a name that speaks for itself — a brand for those who wear courage, attitude, and authenticity on their sleeve.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        Our collections are not trends. They are movements — shaped by individuality and driven by values. For the streets, from the streets. That’s our DNA.
